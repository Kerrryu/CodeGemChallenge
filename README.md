### Notes

Potential changes:
- When selecting a mood, remove emoji from context menu || (Very easy and quick add)
This was a very quick change which I implemented using a ternary conditional to check if the emoji was located in the selected list. I believe this cleans up the mood checker a little more and gives the user a cleaner experience

- Add placeholder to "Your findings" input field to avoid any confusion that they must type there 
Instead of adding a placeholder value here I simply removed the separate section being there and merged it with the original combo box selection. This doesn't confuse the user as first thing I thought was that I could type in the box "Your findings" but quickly found out I wasn't able to. To deliver a better user experience I merged this input area with the combobox container.

- Cleaned up some more css on the card to remove any weird looking whitespace or issues that are there.
